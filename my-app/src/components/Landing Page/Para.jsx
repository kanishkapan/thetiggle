        Food made with good intention improves food pleasure. We partnered with
        amazing folks of a small farm to source one of India's best cocoa and
        hired a few skilled women at our manufacturing unit. We have a rule to
        work with people with happy energy and that reflects in Tiggle Hot
        Chocolate.
