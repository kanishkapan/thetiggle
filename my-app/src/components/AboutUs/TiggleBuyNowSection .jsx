          Food made with good intention improves food pleasure. We partnered
          with good folks of a small farm to source one of Indiaâ€™s best cocoa.
          We hired two good women at our manufacturing unit. We have the rule to
          work with people with good energy. And that reflects in Tiggle hot
          chocolate. Those who tried will agree!
